## Smart Travel Assistant: Personalized Trip Recommendations Based on Your Budget & Preferences"
* 1️. Gather & Prepare the Data
Look for travel datasets on Kaggle (costs, destinations, ratings).
Use APIs (Skyscanner, Expedia, Google Places, TripAdvisor) for real-world data.
If scraping is needed, consider using BeautifulSoup or Selenium.

* 2️. Build the ML Model
Budget-based recommendation: Regression (predict cost based on budget).
Collaborative filtering: Personalized recommendations based on past traveler data.
Time-based trends: Use time-series (Prophet, LSTM) to predict best travel periods.

* 3️. Develop the Interactive Interface
Use Flask or Streamlit for a simple web app where users input budget/time/preferences.
Use Folium or Plotly to visualize recommended travel spots.
Optional: Integrate real-time APIs to fetch live flight/hotel prices.
* 4️. Test & Optimize
Run predictions on different budgets & preferences.
Improve recommendations with more user feedback (e.g., ratings, past travel history).
Fine-tune models for better accuracy.
